# 📦 Enhanced Pushover Notifications - Now with Part Number & Quantity!

## 🎉 What's New

Your Pushover notifications now include **Part Number** and **Quantity** information extracted from each processed PO!

## 📱 Updated Notification Content

### ✅ **Enhanced Success Notifications:**

**Title:** `✅ PO {po_number} Processed Successfully`

**Message Now Includes:**
- 📋 **PO Number** - The extracted purchase order number
- 📁 **Original Filename** - Name of the PDF you dropped in Scans folder
- 📦 **Part Number** - The specific part number from the PO
- 🔢 **Quantity** - How many units are being ordered
- ⏰ **Completion Time** - Exact timestamp when processing finished
- 📂 **Data Folder** - Where the organized PO data is stored

**Example:**
```
Title: ✅ PO 1234567 Processed Successfully

Message: Purchase Order 1234567 has been successfully processed!

📁 Original file: invoice_07292025.pdf
📦 Part Number: ABC-123-XYZ
🔢 Quantity: 27
⏰ Completed: 2025-08-14 07:45:32
📂 Data folder: 1234567
```

### ❌ **Error Notifications** (unchanged):

**Title:** `❌ PO Processing Failed`

**Message Contains:**
- 📄 **Failed Filename** - Which PDF couldn't be processed
- 🚨 **Error Details** - What went wrong during processing
- ⏰ **Error Time** - When the error occurred
- 📁 **Error Location** - Where the file was moved (Errors folder)

## 🔄 Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Data Extraction**: The system now reads the extracted PO details from the JSON file
2. **Richer Notifications**: Part Number and Quantity are included in success notifications
3. **Smart Fallback**: If data can't be extracted, it shows "Not extracted" instead of failing
4. **Consistent Format**: All notifications maintain the same emoji-rich, easy-to-read format

## 📦 Data Extraction Details

The system extracts:
- **Part Number**: From various PO formats and layouts
- **Quantity**: As a whole number (e.g., 27, not 27.00)
- **Fallback Handling**: If extraction fails, shows "Not extracted"

## 🎯 What You'll Know at a Glance

Now when you get a notification, you'll immediately know:
1. ✅ **Success or failure status**
2. 📋 **Which PO number was processed**
3. 📦 **What part is being ordered**
4. 🔢 **How many units**
5. 📁 **Original filename**
6. ⏰ **When it completed**
7. 📂 **Where to find the data**

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **The changes are ready** - next time you process a PDF, you'll get the enhanced notifications
2. **Test it out** - Drop a PDF in the Scans folder to see the new format
3. **No configuration needed** - Your existing Pushover setup will automatically use the new format

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- The notification system now reads from `{po_number}_info.json` files
- Part Number and Quantity extraction happens during the detailed PO processing
- If the JSON file is missing or corrupted, notifications still work with fallback text
- No changes needed to your Pushover configuration

*Your notifications are now even more informative - you'll know exactly what part and quantity were processed!* 📦🎉
