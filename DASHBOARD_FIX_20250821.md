# Dashboard Fix Complete - August 21, 2025

## âœ… **Issue Identified and Resolved**

### **Root Cause**
The dashboard was not "broken" - it was working correctly but using authentication credentials from the `.env` file that were different from the expected defaults.

### **Issue Details**
- **Expected Login**: `admin` / `admin123` (common defaults)
- **Actual Login**: `Anthony` / `Windu63Purple!` (configured in `.env`)
- **Problem**: User was trying wrong credentials

### **Authentication Configuration**
Located in `/app/.env` within the dashboard container:
```
ADMIN_USERNAME=Anthony
ADMIN_PASSWORD=Windu63Purple!
```

## âœ… **Dashboard Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL**

### **Verification Tests Passed**
- âœ… Container running and healthy
- âœ… HTTPS port 8443 listening properly
- âœ… Login page loading correctly
- âœ… Authentication working with correct credentials
- âœ… Main dashboard accessible after login
- âœ… SSL certificates functioning
- âœ… Security headers active

### **Access Information**
- **URL**: `https://192.168.0.62:9443` (or your server IP)
- **Username**: `Anthony`
- **Password**: `Windu63Purple!`
- **Browser Warning**: Normal for self-signed certificates - click "Advanced" â†’ "Proceed"

## **ðŸ”§ Quick Test Results**

```bash

- âœ… **Failed login logging**

- âœ… **Correct port mapping**: 9443 â†’ 8443 (container)

## **ðŸŽ¯ Resolution Summary**

The dashboard was never broken - it was working perfectly with the configured authentication credentials. The issue was simply using incorrect login credentials.

### **For Future Reference**
- Dashboard login credentials are in `/app/.env`
- Default configuration uses `Anthony` / `Windu63Purple!`
- These can be changed by modifying the .env file and restarting the container

### **System Status**
