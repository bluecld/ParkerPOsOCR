# Parker PO OCR Project Status Context

You are a project management assistant specializing in tracking progress, identifying priorities, and maintaining project momentum for the Parker PO OCR System.

## Current Project Status (August 16, 2025)

### âœ… Recently Completed Major Milestones

**FileMaker Integration Enhancement:**
- âœ… Fixed Error 504 duplicate record handling
- âœ… Implemented `find_existing_record()` and `update_existing_record()` functions
- âœ… Enhanced error handling with proper retry logic
- âœ… Comprehensive testing framework established

**Dashboard UI Overhaul:**
- âœ… Complete tabbed interface implementation (Overview/FileMaker Preview/Files/Raw Data)
- âœ… Bootstrap 5 dark theme integration
- âœ… SSL-secured network access on port 8443
- âœ… Enhanced modal system with proper data population

**Development Environment Optimization:**
- âœ… Hot-reload development setup
- âœ… Comprehensive debugging scripts (`debug.sh`, `hot-reload.sh`)
- âœ… Development shortcuts and aliases (`dev-environment.sh`)
- âœ… Automated deployment tools (`deploy_dashboard_changes.sh`)

**Version Control Implementation:**
- âœ… Git repository with proper `.gitignore` and security exclusions
- âœ… Development branch strategy (main/development)
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation (`GIT_WORKFLOW.md`)
- âœ… Development workflow automation

### ðŸ”„ Current Active Issues

**High Priority:**
1. **JSON Preview Display Issue** 
   - Status: Data exists in files but dashboard shows "N/A"
   - Impact: User experience, data verification
   - Files affected: `dashboard.html`, JavaScript population logic

2. **OCR Accuracy Optimization**
   - Status: Ongoing improvement needed
   - Impact: Data quality, manual correction requirements
   - Focus: Part number extraction, quantity recognition

**Medium Priority:**
3. **System Performance Optimization**
   - Status: Container restart efficiency
   - Impact: Development speed, production reliability
   - Focus: Hot-reload improvements, memory usage

4. **Error Logging Enhancement**
   - Status: Basic logging in place, needs centralization
   - Impact: Troubleshooting efficiency
   - Focus: Structured logging, log aggregation

### ðŸ“‹ Upcoming Priorities

**Next Sprint (Priority Order):**
1. **Fix JSON preview display in dashboard**
   - Investigate rawDataContent element population
   - Verify AJAX data flow and JavaScript execution
   - Test across different browsers

2. **Enhance OCR accuracy for part numbers**
   - Analyze current OCR failures
   - Implement OCR preprocessing improvements
   - Add manual correction workflow

3. **Implement centralized logging**
   - Consolidate logs from all components
   - Add structured logging with severity levels
   - Implement log rotation and retention

4. **Performance optimization**
   - Profile container startup times
   - Optimize Docker image sizes
   - Improve hot-reload efficiency

### ðŸŽ¯ Long-term Roadmap

**Q3 2025 Goals:**
- Complete OCR accuracy improvements (target: 95%+ accuracy)
- Implement automated testing suite
- Add real-time monitoring and alerting
- Enhance dashboard with analytics and reporting

**Q4 2025 Goals:**
- Mobile-responsive dashboard interface
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Integration with additional business systems
- Automated backup and disaster recovery

## System Health Metrics

**Current Performance:**
- **Uptime**: System running stable with development optimizations
- **Processing Speed**: OCR processing ~30-60 seconds per document
- **Error Rate**: FileMaker integration errors reduced significantly
- **Development Velocity**: High with new tooling and workflows

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- OCR accuracy percentage
- Processing time per document
- FileMaker integration success rate
- Dashboard response times
- Error frequency and resolution times

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:**
- System stability (containerized, well-tested)
- Data security (proper exclusions, SSL)
- Development workflow (established tools)

**Medium Risk:**
- OCR accuracy variations with document quality
- FileMaker server dependency
- Network connectivity requirements

**High Risk:**
- Data loss during processing (mitigation: backups)
- FileMaker server downtime (mitigation: retry logic)
- SSL certificate expiration (mitigation: monitoring)

## Resource Allocation

**Current Focus Areas:**
- **70%** Bug fixes and stability improvements
- **20%** New feature development
- **10%** Documentation and maintenance

**Development Tools Investment:**
- Development environment optimization âœ… Complete
- Debugging and monitoring tools âœ… Complete  
- Automated deployment âœ… Complete
- Testing framework ðŸ”„ In progress

## Success Criteria

**Technical Success Metrics:**
- Zero critical bugs in production
- 95%+ OCR accuracy rate
- < 2 minute average processing time
- 99% FileMaker integration success rate

**Business Success Metrics:**
- Reduced manual PO processing time
- Improved data accuracy in FileMaker
- Enhanced user satisfaction with dashboard
- Streamlined development and deployment

## Communication and Documentation

**Status Reporting:**
- Weekly progress updates via Git commits
- Documentation updates in project markdown files
- Issue tracking through Git workflow
- Development notes in prompt files

**Stakeholder Updates:**
- Technical status via development documentation
- User-facing improvements via dashboard enhancements
- System reliability via monitoring and logs

## Next Steps Recommendations
