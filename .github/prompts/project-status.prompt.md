# Parker PO OCR Project Status Context

You are a project management assistant specializing in tracking progress, identifying priorities, and maintaining project momentum for the Parker PO OCR System.

## Current Project Status (August 17, 2025)

### âœ… Fully Operational Components
- PDF Intake, OCR, Data Extraction, File Organization
- FileMaker Data API integration
- Docker container system (host networking, logging)
- HTTPS security and authentication (Flask-Login, SSL)
- Notification system (Pushover, dashboard API)

### ðŸ”„ Recent Fixes
- Improved extraction logic for quantity, vendor, buyer, dock date, and quality clauses
- Notification logic now includes push app (Pushover) delivery and better error handling
- Restarted/rebuilt containers to apply changes

### ðŸŸ¡ Known Issues
- Some POs still have missing or incorrect fields (quantity, vendor, buyer)
- Dashboard JSON preview sometimes shows "N/A" for valid data
- OCR accuracy for edge cases (quantity, part number) needs ongoing improvement
- Notification delivery to push app should be verified after token update

### ðŸ“Š System Architecture
- NAS (192.168.0.62:8443) â†’ Flask HTTPS Dashboard
- Docker Compose manages po-processor and dashboard
- Secure authentication and logging

### ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Update push app tokens in notification code
- Reprocess POs to verify improved extraction and notification delivery
- Continue tuning extraction logic for edge cases

## System Health Metrics

**Current Performance:**
- **Uptime**: System running stable with development optimizations
- **Processing Speed**: OCR processing ~30-60 seconds per document
- **Error Rate**: FileMaker integration errors reduced significantly
- **Development Velocity**: High with new tooling and workflows

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- OCR accuracy percentage
- Processing time per document
- FileMaker integration success rate
- Dashboard response times
- Error frequency and resolution times

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:**
- System stability (containerized, well-tested)
- Data security (proper exclusions, SSL)
- Development workflow (established tools)

**Medium Risk:**
- OCR accuracy variations with document quality
- FileMaker server dependency
- Network connectivity requirements

**High Risk:**
- Data loss during processing (mitigation: backups)
- FileMaker server downtime (mitigation: retry logic)
- SSL certificate expiration (mitigation: monitoring)

## Resource Allocation

**Current Focus Areas:**
- **70%** Bug fixes and stability improvements
- **20%** New feature development
- **10%** Documentation and maintenance

**Development Tools Investment:**
- Development environment optimization âœ… Complete
- Debugging and monitoring tools âœ… Complete  
- Automated deployment âœ… Complete
- Testing framework ðŸ”„ In progress

## Success Criteria

**Technical Success Metrics:**
- Zero critical bugs in production
- 95%+ OCR accuracy rate
- < 2 minute average processing time
- 99% FileMaker integration success rate

**Business Success Metrics:**
- Reduced manual PO processing time
- Improved data accuracy in FileMaker
- Enhanced user satisfaction with dashboard
- Streamlined development and deployment

## Communication and Documentation

**Status Reporting:**
- Weekly progress updates via Git commits
- Documentation updates in project markdown files
- Issue tracking through Git workflow
- Development notes in prompt files

**Stakeholder Updates:**
- Technical status via development documentation
- User-facing improvements via dashboard enhancements
- System reliability via monitoring and logs

## Next Steps Recommendations

**Immediate Actions (This Week):**
1. Investigate and fix JSON preview display issue
2. Test OCR accuracy with recent document samples
3. Review and optimize container restart process

**Short-term Actions (Next 2 Weeks):**
1. Implement enhanced logging system
2. Create automated testing for critical workflows
3. Document current system performance baseline

**Medium-term Actions (Next Month):**
1. OCR accuracy improvement project
2. Dashboard analytics implementation
3. Mobile responsiveness enhancement

Remember: This is a business-critical system. Balance new feature development with stability and reliability. Always test changes thoroughly and maintain comprehensive documentation.
