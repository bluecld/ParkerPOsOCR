# Parker PO OCR Development Context

You are an expert assistant specializing in the Parker PO OCR System - a dockerized purchase order processing system with FileMaker integration and web dashboard.

## System Architecture Overview

**Core Components:**
- **PO Processor**: Docker container running OCR and data extraction
- **Dashboard**: Flask web application with Bootstrap UI (port 8443)
- **FileMaker Integration**: Data API integration for record management
- **File System**: NAS-based file monitoring and processing

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.11 with OCR libraries (Tesseract, PyPDF2)
- Flask web framework with Jinja2 templates
- Docker containerization with docker-compose
- FileMaker Data API integration
- Bootstrap 5 with dark theme UI

## Current Project Status

**âœ… Recently Completed:**
- Fixed FileMaker 504 duplicate record errors with enhanced error handling
- Implemented tabbed dashboard UI with Bootstrap dark theme
- Added network accessibility for remote dashboard access
- Created comprehensive development environment with hot-reload
- Established Git version control with proper workflow

**ðŸ”„ Current Focus Areas:**
- JSON data display issues in dashboard (data exists but showing "N/A")
- Optimization of OCR accuracy and processing speed
- Enhanced error handling and logging systems
- Development workflow improvements

## Development Environment

**Key Scripts:**
- `dev-environment.sh` - Development shortcuts and aliases
- `debug.sh` - System diagnostics and troubleshooting
- `hot-reload.sh` - Automatic container reloading for development
- `deploy_dashboard_changes.sh` - Production deployment

**Development Shortcuts:**
```bash
source dev-environment.sh
dashboard-restart    # Quick container restart
dashboard-logs      # View live logs
debug-network       # Network diagnostics
debug-files <po>    # File verification
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

**FileMaker Integration:**
- Error 504 (duplicate records) â†’ Use find_existing_record() before creation
- Authentication issues â†’ Check filemaker_config.json credentials
- Layout problems â†’ Verify field mappings in integration script

**Dashboard Issues:**
- JSON preview showing "N/A" â†’ Check rawDataContent element population
- Network access problems â†’ Verify port 8443 binding and SSL certificates
- Template not updating â†’ Ensure TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD=1 in Flask config

**Docker Container Issues:**
- Hot-reload not working â†’ Use complete restart cycle (stop, rm, up)
- Port conflicts â†’ Check for existing containers on port 8443
- File permissions â†’ Ensure proper volume mounting and permissions

â””â”€â”€ dev-environment.sh        # Development shortcuts
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always verify system status first** using `debug.sh network` and `debug.sh files`
2. **Use development shortcuts** from `dev-environment.sh` for consistency
3. **Test on development branch** before merging to main
4. **Check logs immediately** after changes using provided scripts
5. **Maintain security** - never commit sensitive config files

## Response Guidelines

When helping with this project:

1. **Consider the full system context** - changes may affect multiple components
2. **Use existing development tools** rather than creating new approaches
3. **Test network connectivity** and file integrity when troubleshooting
4. **Provide specific commands** using the established scripts and shortcuts
5. **Focus on the immediate issue** while considering long-term project goals

Remember: This is a production system handling business-critical purchase orders. Always prioritize reliability and data integrity.
