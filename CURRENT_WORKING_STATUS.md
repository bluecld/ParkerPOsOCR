# PO Processing System - Current Working Status
**Date**: August 17, 2025  
**Session**: Extraction & Notification System Improvements

## ðŸŽ‰ FULLY OPERATIONAL COMPONENTS

### 1. Core PDF Processing Pipeline âœ…
- PDF Intake, OCR, Data Extraction, File Organization
- FileMaker Data API integration
- Docker container system (host networking, logging)
- HTTPS security and authentication (Flask-Login, SSL)
- Notification system (Pushover, dashboard API)

### 2. Recent Fixes âœ…
- Improved extraction logic for quantity, vendor, buyer, dock date, and quality clauses
- Notification logic now includes push app (Pushover) delivery and better error handling
- Restarted/rebuilt containers to apply changes

## ðŸŸ¡ KNOWN ISSUES
- Some POs still have missing or incorrect fields (quantity, vendor, buyer)
- Dashboard JSON preview sometimes shows "N/A" for valid data
- OCR accuracy for edge cases (quantity, part number) needs ongoing improvement
- Notification delivery to push app should be verified after token update

## ðŸ“Š SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
- NAS (192.168.0.62:8443) â†’ Flask HTTPS Dashboard
- Docker Compose manages po-processor and dashboard
- Secure authentication and logging

## ðŸš€ NEXT STEPS
- Update push app tokens in notification code
- Reprocess POs to verify improved extraction and notification delivery
- Continue tuning extraction logic for edge cases
